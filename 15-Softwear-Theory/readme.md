Here's a quick overview of each:

1. **System Design**:

   - System design is the **process of defining the architecture and components** of a complete software solution. It involves designing how different parts of the system interact, handle data, scale, and meet requirements like reliability and performance.
   - Example: Designing a high-level structure for an e-commerce system, including databases, load balancers, and microservices.

2. **Design Patterns**:

   - Design patterns are **reusable solutions to common software design problems**. Theyâ€™re like templates that developers can follow to solve specific design issues.
   - Examples: Singleton (ensures a class has one instance), Observer (allows objects to react to state changes in other objects).

3. **Software Architecture**:
   - Software architecture is the **blueprint for the system** that defines the high-level structure, components, and their interactions. It sets the foundation for technical standards and guidelines.
   - Examples: Layered architecture (separates logic into layers), Microservices architecture (small, independent services).

Each of these concepts helps developers design, build, and maintain scalable and efficient software solutions.
